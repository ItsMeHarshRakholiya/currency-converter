# Currency Converter

A simple currency converter application built with JavaScript to practice and learn the asynchronous functionality using async/await. This project uses the Fixer.io API for exchange rates and the restcountries API for currency information.

## Features

- Convert between different currencies.
- Real-time exchange rate updates.
- User-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Axios for API requests
- HTML/CSS for the UI

## APIs Used

- [Fixer.io](https://fixer.io/) for exchange rates.
- [Restcountries](https://restcountries.com/) for currency information.

## Async/Await
The project utilizes JavaScript's async/await functionality to handle asynchronous operations, making it easy to fetch and update exchange rates without blocking the UI.
